# Hi, Iâ€™m Sanjana (@JuJams)

- Iâ€™m a senior studying **Computer Science** at **NYU**, focusing on **UI/UX design** and **software development**.
- Iâ€™m currently learning and diving deeper into **user experience design**, **front-end development**, and **building intuitive interfaces**.
- Technologies I love working with include **Python**, **Java**, **HTML/CSS**, **React**, and **SQL**.
- Iâ€™m passionate about **design**, **algorithmic problem-solving**, and creating products that bring joy to users.
- Iâ€™m open to collaborating on **UI/UX projects**, **front-end development**, or anything creative that involves **user-centered design**.
- Iâ€™m fascinated by **people-watching**, understanding human behavior, and incorporating those insights into design.
- I love **growing plants**, and my heart sinks a little if they donâ€™t make it ðŸ˜¢.
- I absolutely adore going on **sunset walks**â€”itâ€™s my favorite way to unwind after a busy day.
- In my free time, I enjoy exploring the world of **UI/UX design**, experimenting with new layouts, and creating engaging digital experiences.
- Feel free to reach out to me on **GitHub** or via **LinkedIn** if you'd like to collaborate or chat about design!

âš¡ **Fun fact**: If you donâ€™t find me coding, Iâ€™m probably either **watching people** go by or taking care of my plants!
